    "1. What is a Database?\n",
    "\n",
    "A database is a collection of data stored in a format that can be easily accessed. In order to manage our databases we use a software called **database management system (DBMS)**. DBMS are categorized as two broad categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Relational\n",
    "\n",
    "+ NoSQL\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Relational DBMS\n",
    "\n",
    "We store data in tables that are linked to each other using relationships, each table stores data about the specific type of object. We use **Structured Query Language (SQL)** to work with these relational DBMS. We use SQL to query or modify our data. \n",
    "There are various RDBMS like:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ MySQL\n",
    "+ SQL Server\n",
    "+ Oracle\n",
    "+ ...\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these flavors are based on the standard specifications of SQL. So what I learn in this course mostly can be applied to any of these RDBMS. In this course we use MySQL, which is the most popular open source database in the world. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Non relational databases\n",
    "\n",
    "In Non relational databases we don’t have tables or relationships, these databases are very different from relational databases and NoSQL systems don’t understand SQL and they have their own query language. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Course structure\n",
    "\n",
    "What you will learn: \n",
    "\n",
    "+ Retrieving data\n",
    "+ Inserting data\n",
    "+ Updating data\n",
    "+ Deleting data\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though we use MySQL in this course, what you will be learning will be applicable at least 90% to other DBMSs. There might be a slight difference in syntax though. \n",
    "\n",
    "You also learn\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Summarizing data for creating reports\n",
    "+ Writing complex queries using subqueries\n",
    "+ Built-in functions \n",
    "\n",
    "As you process you see you are writing the same queries again and again and so you will learn about the followings for storing queries and reusing them later:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Views\n",
    "+ Stored procedures \n",
    "\n",
    "These are great for increasing your productivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we move on to advanced topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Triggers\n",
    "+ Events\n",
    "+ Transactions\n",
    "+ Concurrency\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to stand out among the crowds you have to learn about:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Designing databases\n",
    "\n",
    "Mosh dedicated a complete in-depth section on it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then we look at \n",
    "+ Indexing for high performance, indexes are essential when your database grows in size, we can speed up our queries using indexes. If you have billions of records you want to query pretty quick using indexes \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally we finish the course by \n",
    "+ Securing databases\n",
    "\n",
    "## Retrieving Data From a Single Table\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The SELECT statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "    USE sql_store; \n",
    "    \n",
    "    SELECT * (in front of that we specify the columns that we want to retrieve, * means all columns) \n",
    "    FROM customers (here we specify the table that we want to query)\n",
    "    WHERE customer_id = 1 (we use this clause to filter data)\n",
    "    ORDER BY first_name (we use this clause to sort data and here we specify the columns that we want to sort the results on)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step to write a query to get data from a database is to select the database, the query that we write will be executed against that database. We use **USE** keyword to select the database. \n",
    "\n",
    "Points:\n",
    "+ SQL is NOT a case sensitive language meaning we can use USE sql_store or use sql_store BUT as the best practice we should **capitalize all the SQL keywords and everything else in lower case**\n",
    "+ When you have multiple SQL statements we need to terminate each statement using a semicolon (;) \n",
    "+ Comment in SQL is two hyphens –- and the SQL engine will not execute these comments \n",
    "\n",
    "After executing:\n",
    "+ USE sql_store (by double clicking on the sql_store we can achieve the same thing)\n",
    "\n",
    "The sql_store is marked as bold in the schemas database (in the left panel) \n",
    "\n",
    "**The order of these clauses (SELECT FROM WHERE ORDER BY) matter. And if we don’t follow the above order we get a syntax error.\n",
    "\n",
    "The three clauses of **FROM, WHERE, ORDER BY are all optional** but we mostly use them. \n",
    "Also we don’t need to put different clauses in different lines b/c tab, whitespaces, and line breaks are ignored when SQL code is executed. So we may have\n",
    "\n",
    "    SELECT * FROM customers WHERE customer_id = 1 ORDER BY first_name \n",
    "\n",
    "This is fine for simple queries but as your queries get more complex it is better to put each clause on a new line. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. The AND, OR, and NOT operators \n",
    "\n",
    "AND is operated first! But we use parenthesis to make our code cleaner and easier to understand. \n",
