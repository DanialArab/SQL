# Structured Query Language 

This repository documents my solutions to the **Leetcode - Database questions using SQL**. The Leetcode databases are first needed to be regenerated in my MySQL server using the SQL Schema, presented along with each Leetcode question. This is required to be able to make a query in the Jupyter Notebook. All of my solutions are presented in Jupyter Notebook **<a href="https://github.com/DanialArab/SQL/blob/master/Leetcode%20Database%20Questions/Leetcode_Database_Questions.ipynb">Leetcode_Database_Questions</a>**. This repo contains the following directories and each one contains the pertinent files including README and Jupyter Notebook files:
