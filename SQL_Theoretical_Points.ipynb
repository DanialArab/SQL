    "\n",
    "A database is a collection of data stored in a format that can be easily accessed. In order to manage our databases we use a software called **database management system (DBMS)**. DBMS are categorized as two broad categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Relational\n",
    "\n",
    "+ NoSQL\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Relational DBMS**\n",
    "\n",
    "We store data in tables that are linked to each other using relationships, each table stores data about the specific type of object. We use **Structured Query Language (SQL)** to work with these relational DBMS. We use SQL to query or modify our data. \n",
    "There are various RDBMS like:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ MySQL\n",
    "+ SQL Server\n",
    "+ Oracle\n",
    "+ ...\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these flavors are based on the standard specifications of SQL. So what I learn in this course mostly can be applied to any of these RDBMS. In this course we use MySQL, which is the most popular open source database in the world. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Non relational databases**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Non relational databases we don‚Äôt have tables or relationships, these databases are very different from relational databases and NoSQL systems don‚Äôt understand SQL and they have their own query language. \n",

    "+ Retrieving data\n",
    "+ Inserting data\n",
    "+ Updating data\n",
    "+ Deleting data\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though we use MySQL in this course, what you will be learning will be applicable at least 90% to other DBMSs. There might be a slight difference in syntax though. \n",

    "+ Writing complex queries using subqueries\n",
    "+ Built-in functions \n",

    "\n",
    "**5. The SELECT statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "    USE sql_store; \n",
    "    \n",
    "    SELECT * (in front of that we specify the columns that we want to retrieve, * means all columns) \n",
    "    FROM customers (here we specify the table that we want to query)\n",
    "    WHERE customer_id = 1 (we use this clause to filter data)\n",
    "    ORDER BY first_name (we use this clause to sort data and here we specify the columns that we want to sort the results on)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step to write a query to get data from a database is to select the database, the query that we write will be executed against that database. We use **USE** keyword to select the database. \n",
    "\n",
    "Points:\n",
    "+ SQL is NOT a case sensitive language meaning we can use USE sql_store or use sql_store BUT as the best practice we should **capitalize all the SQL keywords and everything else in lower case**\n",
    "+ When you have multiple SQL statements we need to terminate each statement using a semicolon (;) \n",
    "+ Comment in SQL is two hyphens ‚Äì- and the SQL engine will not execute these comments \n",
    "\n",
    "After executing:\n",
    "+ USE sql_store (by double clicking on the sql_store we can achieve the same thing)\n",
    "\n",
    "The sql_store is marked as bold in the schemas database (in the left panel) \n",
    "\n",
    "**The order of these clauses (SELECT FROM WHERE ORDER BY) matter. And if we don‚Äôt follow the above order we get a syntax error.\n",
    "\n",
    "The three clauses of **FROM, WHERE, ORDER BY are all optional** but we mostly use them. \n",
    "Also we don‚Äôt need to put different clauses in different lines b/c tab, whitespaces, and line breaks are ignored when SQL code is executed. So we may have\n",
    "\n",
    "    SELECT * FROM customers WHERE customer_id = 1 ORDER BY first_name \n",
    "\n",
    "This is fine for simple queries but as your queries get more complex it is better to put each clause on a new line. \n",
    "\n",
    "**6. The AND, OR, and NOT operators**\n",
    "\n",
    "AND is operated first! But we use parenthesis to make our code cleaner and easier to understand. \n",
    "\n",
    "**7. The IN operator in SQL**\n",
    "\n",
    "        USE sql_stores; \n",
    "        \n",

    "\n",
    "        SELECT *\n",
    "        FROM customers \n",
    "        WHERE state IN (‚ÄòVA‚Äô, ‚ÄòGA‚Äô, ‚ÄòFL‚Äô) -- The order does NOT matter \n",
    "\n",
    "We also can use NOT operator like to get the customers outside of these states:\n",
    "\n",
    "        SELECT *\n",
    "        FROM customers \n",
    "        WHERE state NOT IN (‚ÄòVA‚Äô, ‚ÄòGA‚Äô, ‚ÄòFL‚Äô)\n",
    "        \n",
    "**8. The BETWEEN operator in SQL**\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever we are comparing an attribute with a range of values we can use **BETWEEN operator** to make you code shorter and cleaner like:\n",
    "\n",
    "    USE sql_store;\n",
    "    SELECT *\n",
    "    FROM customers \n",
    "    WHERE points BETWEEN 1000 AND 3000 -- The range values is inclusive. \n",
    "    \n",
    "**9. The LIKE operator**\n",
    "\n",
    "How to retrieve rows that match a specific string pattern? Like we want to get the customers whose last names starts with ‚Äúb‚Äù:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use % to indicate any number of characters after ‚Äúb‚Äù, also it doesn‚Äôt matter if it is a lower case or upper case ‚Äúb‚Äù**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    SELECT *\n",
    "    FROM customers\n",
    "    WHERE last_name LIKE ‚Äúb%‚Äù\n",
    "    \n",
    "The percent sign doesn‚Äôt have to be at the end but it could be anywhere like we want to get customers with ‚Äúb‚Äù character in their last name whether in the beginning or at the end or in the middle, for that we change our pattern to **‚Äú%b%‚Äù** meaning we can have any number of characters before or after ‚Äúb‚Äù:\n",
    "\n",
    "    SELECT *\n",
    "    FROM customers\n",
    "    WHERE last_name LIKE ‚Äú%b%‚Äù\n",
    "    \n",
    "For the customers with last name ending in ‚Äúy‚Äù we use this pattern ‚Äú%y‚Äù. We also have **underscore ‚Äú_‚Äùthat matches a single character** like in the following we will get the customers whose last names are exactly TWO characters long and it ends in y and we don‚Äôt care what the first character is:\n",
    "\n",
    "    SELECT *\n",
    "    FROM customers \n",
    "    WHERE last_name LIKE ‚Äú_y‚Äù\n",

    "Another pattern is ‚Äúb____y‚Äù and you know what it meansüòä \n",
    "\n",
    "The LIKE operator in MySQL is an older operator and we have a newer one which is more powerful which allows us to search for any string pattern. We will discuss next. \n",
    "\n",
    "**10. The REGEXP operator**\n",
    "\n",
    "REGEXP is short for regular expression. REGEXP is extremely powerful when it comes to **searching for strings**. They allow us to search for more complex patterns. **The newer and better operator compared to LIKE.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let‚Äôs say if we want to have customers whose last names include field, if we want to use LIKE operator:\n",
    "\n",
    "    SELECT *\n",
    "    FROM customers\n",
    "    WHERE last_name LIKE ‚Äú%field%‚Äù\n",
    "    \n",
    "BUT if we use REGEXP we do NOT need % to indicate that the field word could be anywhere and the above query would be simplified to as:\n",
    "\n",
    "    SELECT *\n",
    "    FROM customers\n",
    "    WHERE last_name REGEXP ‚Äúfield‚Äù\n",
    "    \n",
    "In REGEXP we have additional characters that we don‚Äôt have in LIKE operator. Like\n",
    "\n",
    "+ ^\tto indicate the beginning of the string like\n",
    "\n",
    "        WHERE last_name REGEXP ‚Äú^field‚Äù\tmeans the last_name MUST start with field\n",
    "        \n",
    "+ $\tto indicate the end of the string like \n",
    "\n",
    "        WHERE last_name REGEXP ‚Äúfield$‚Äù means the last name must end with field\n",
    "        \n",
    "+ We can also search for multiple words, to do so we use **pipe (|) for logical or** for multiple search patterns, like to get customers who have field or mac in their last names:\n",
    "\n",
    "        WHERE last_name REGEXP ‚Äúfield|mac‚Äù \n",
    "        \n",
    "+ We can take this to the next level like finding customers who have the words field or mac or rose in their last names:\n",
    "\n",
    "        WHERE last_name REGEXP ‚Äúfiels|mac|rose‚Äù\n",
    "\n",
    "        WHERE last_name REGEXP ‚Äú^field|mac$|rose‚Äù\n",
    "        \n",
    "+ We want to get customers who have letter e in their last names and also before the letter e there is either g or i, to achieve this we use square brackets [] and inside it we can add multiple characters like ‚Äú[gi]e‚Äù\n",
    "\n",
    "        WHERE last_name REGEXP ‚Äú[gi]e‚Äù\n",
    "        \n",
    "        WHERE last_name REGEXP ‚Äúe[gi]‚Äù\n",

    "\n",
    "        WHERE last_name REGEXP ‚Äú[a-h]e‚Äù\n",
    "        \n",
    "There are more special characters in MySQL than listed above but honestly the ones on above are the ones you use 90 % of the times. So just learn these and you are good to go! \n",

    "\n",
    "How to look for records that miss an attribute? Like if we want to find all the customers that don‚Äôt have a phone number and like we want to send an email to them and say please provide phone number. To do so we use IS NULL operator:\n",
    "\n",
    "    SELECT *\n",
    "    FROM customers\n",
    "    WHERE phone IS NULL \n",
    "    \n",

    "\n",
    "Because the customer_id column is the **primary key column** for the table customers. You can figure it out by clicking the tools like button on the right of the table customers name and then see the customer table in the design mode. Here you see that there is a yellow key just before the customer_id meaning this is a primary key column for this table. **In relational databased every table should have a primary key column and the values in that column should uniquely identify the records in that table**. So that is why in our query the data is sorted by the custiomer_id which is the primary key. To sort the customers by different column:\n",
    "\n",
    "    SELECT *\n",
    "    FROM customers \n",

    "    SELECT *\n",
    "    FROM customers\n",
    "    ORDER BY state, first_name \n",
    "    \n",

    "    SELECT *\n",
    "    FROM customers\n",
    "    ORDER BY state, first_name DESC \n",
    "    \n",
    "The difference between MySQL and other DBMSs is that in MySQL we can sort by any columns whether that column is in the SELECT clause or NOT like:\n",

    "    SELECT first_name, last_name\n",
    "    FROM customers\n",
    "    ORDER BY state\n",
    "    \n",

    "The output would be all the columns from the two tables, first all the columns from orders table, b/c we have listed this table first, and then all the columns from the customers table. Let‚Äôs simplify the results:\n",
