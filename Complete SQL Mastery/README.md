### Introduction 

<a name="2"></a>
#### What is a Database? 

A database is a collection of data stored in a format that can be easily accessed. In order to manage our databases we use a software called database management system (DBMS). DBMS are categorized as two broad categories:

+ Relational
+ NoSQL

<a name="3"></a>
#### Relational DBMS

We store data in tables that are linked to each other using relationships, each table stores data about a specific type of object. We use Structured Query Language (SQL) to work with these relational DBMSs. We use SQL to query or modify our data. There are various RDBMS:

+ MySQL
+ SQL Server
+ Oracle
+ ...

All of these flavors are based on the standard specifications of SQL. So what I learn in this course mostly can be applied to any of these RDBMS. In this course, we use MySQL, which is the most popular open-source database in the world.

<a name="4"></a>
#### Non-relational databases

In Non-relational databases, we don‚Äôt have tables or relationships, these databases are very different from relational databases and NoSQL systems don‚Äôt understand SQL and they have their own query language.

<a name="5"></a>
#### Course structure

Even though we use MySQL in this course, what we will be learning will be applicable at least 90% to other DBMSs. There might be a slight difference in syntax though.

Topics: 

+ Retrieving data
+ Inserting data
+ Updating data
+ Deleting data
+ Summarizing data for creating reports
+ Writing complex queries using subqueries
+ Built-in functions

As you process you see you are writing the same queries again and again and so we will learn about the followings for **storing queries and reusing them** later:

+ Views
+ Stored procedures

These are great for increasing our productivity.

Some advanced topics:

+ Triggers
+ Events
+ Transactions
+ Concurrency

Skills helping an individual stand out: 

+ Designing databases
+ Indexing for high performance, indexes are essential when your database grows in size, we can speed up our queries using indexes. If you have billions of records you want to query pretty quickly using indexes
+ Securing databases

### Retrieving Data From a Single Table 

<a name="7"></a>
#### The SELECT statement

        USE sql_store; 
        
        SELECT * (in front of that we specify the columns that we want to retrieve, * means all columns) 
        FROM customers (here we specify the table that we want to query)
        WHERE customer_id = 1 (we use this clause to filter data)
        ORDER BY first_name 
        
(we use this clause to sort data and here we specify the columns that we want to sort the results on)
The first step to write a query to get data from a database is to select the database, the query that we write will be executed against that database. We use USE keyword to select the database.

Points:

SQL is NOT a case sensitive language meaning we can use USE sql_store or use sql_store BUT as the best practice we should capitalize all the SQL keywords and everything else in lower case
When you have multiple SQL statements we need to terminate each statement using a semicolon (;)
Comment in SQL is two hyphens ‚Äì- and the SQL engine will not execute these comments
After executing:

USE sql_store (by double clicking on the sql_store we can achieve the same thing)
The sql_store is marked as bold in the schemas database (in the left panel)

**The order of these clauses (SELECT FROM WHERE ORDER BY) matter. And if we don‚Äôt follow the above order we get a syntax error.

The three clauses of FROM, WHERE, ORDER BY are all optional but we mostly use them. Also we don‚Äôt need to put different clauses in different lines b/c tab, whitespaces, and line breaks are ignored when SQL code is executed. So we may have

SELECT * FROM customers WHERE customer_id = 1 ORDER BY first_name 
This is fine for simple queries but as your queries get more complex it is better to put each clause on a new line.

6. The AND, OR, and NOT operators

AND is operated first! But we use parenthesis to make our code cleaner and easier to understand.

7. The IN operator in SQL

    USE sql_stores; 
    
    SELECT *
    FROM customers 
    WHERE state = ‚ÄòVA‚Äô OR state = ‚ÄòFL‚Äô OR state = ‚ÄòGA‚Äô 
    
But we can use IN operator to have a cleaner code like

    SELECT *
    FROM customers 
    WHERE state IN (‚ÄòVA‚Äô, ‚ÄòGA‚Äô, ‚ÄòFL‚Äô) -- The order does NOT matter 
We also can use NOT operator like to get the customers outside of these states:

    SELECT *
    FROM customers 
    WHERE state NOT IN (‚ÄòVA‚Äô, ‚ÄòGA‚Äô, ‚ÄòFL‚Äô)
    
8. The BETWEEN operator in SQL

Whenever we are comparing an attribute with a range of values we can use BETWEEN operator to make you code shorter and cleaner like:

USE sql_store;
SELECT *
FROM customers 
WHERE points BETWEEN 1000 AND 3000 -- The range values is inclusive. 
9. The LIKE operator

How to retrieve rows that match a specific string pattern? Like we want to get the customers whose last names starts with ‚Äúb‚Äù:

Use % to indicate any number of characters after ‚Äúb‚Äù, also it doesn‚Äôt matter if it is a lower case or upper case ‚Äúb‚Äù

SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE last_name LIKE ‚Äúb%‚Äù
The percent sign doesn‚Äôt have to be at the end but it could be anywhere like we want to get customers with ‚Äúb‚Äù character in their last name whether in the beginning or at the end or in the middle, for that we change our pattern to ‚Äú%b%‚Äù meaning we can have any number of characters before or after ‚Äúb‚Äù:

SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE last_name LIKE ‚Äú%b%‚Äù
For the customers with last name ending in ‚Äúy‚Äù we use this pattern ‚Äú%y‚Äù. We also have underscore ‚Äú_‚Äùthat matches a single character like in the following we will get the customers whose last names are exactly TWO characters long and it ends in y and we don‚Äôt care what the first character is:

SELECT *
FROM customers 
WHERE last_name LIKE ‚Äú_y‚Äù
Another pattern is ‚Äúb____y‚Äù and you know what it meansüòä

The LIKE operator in MySQL is an older operator and we have a newer one which is more powerful which allows us to search for any string pattern. We will discuss next.

10. The REGEXP operator

REGEXP is short for regular expression. REGEXP is extremely powerful when it comes to searching for strings. They allow us to search for more complex patterns. The newer and better operator compared to LIKE.

Some examples:

Let‚Äôs say if we want to have customers whose last names include field, if we want to use LIKE operator:

SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE last_name LIKE ‚Äú%field%‚Äù
BUT if we use REGEXP we do NOT need % to indicate that the field word could be anywhere and the above query would be simplified to as:

SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE last_name REGEXP ‚Äúfield‚Äù
In REGEXP we have additional characters that we don‚Äôt have in LIKE operator. Like

^ to indicate the beginning of the string like

  WHERE last_name REGEXP ‚Äú^field‚Äù	means the last_name MUST start with field
  
$ to indicate the end of the string like

  WHERE last_name REGEXP ‚Äúfield$‚Äù means the last name must end with field
  
We can also search for multiple words, to do so we use pipe (|) for logical or for multiple search patterns, like to get customers who have field or mac in their last names:

  WHERE last_name REGEXP ‚Äúfield|mac‚Äù 
  
We can take this to the next level like finding customers who have the words field or mac or rose in their last names:

  WHERE last_name REGEXP ‚Äúfiels|mac|rose‚Äù

  WHERE last_name REGEXP ‚Äú^field|mac$|rose‚Äù
  
We want to get customers who have letter e in their last names and also before the letter e there is either g or i, to achieve this we use square brackets [] and inside it we can add multiple characters like ‚Äú[gi]e‚Äù

  WHERE last_name REGEXP ‚Äú[gi]e‚Äù
  
  WHERE last_name REGEXP ‚Äúe[gi]‚Äù
  
We can also supply a range of characters like if we want to have any character from a to h before the letter e

  WHERE last_name REGEXP ‚Äú[a-h]e‚Äù
There are more special characters in MySQL than listed above but honestly the ones on above are the ones you use 90 % of the times. So just learn these and you are good to go!

11. The IS NULL operator

How to look for records that miss an attribute? Like if we want to find all the customers that don‚Äôt have a phone number and like we want to send an email to them and say please provide phone number. To do so we use IS NULL operator:

SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE phone IS NULL 
Here we also can use NOT operator to get the customers who do have a phone like

SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE phone IS NOT NULL
12. The ORDER BY clause

How to sort data in your SQL queries?

By default the data in our query is sorted by the customer_id. Why is the customer_id column the default sort column?

Because the customer_id column is the primary key column for the table customers. You can figure it out by clicking the tools like button on the right of the table customers name and then see the customer table in the design mode. Here you see that there is a yellow key just before the customer_id meaning this is a primary key column for this table. In relational databased every table should have a primary key column and the values in that column should uniquely identify the records in that table. So that is why in our query the data is sorted by the custiomer_id which is the primary key. To sort the customers by different column:

SELECT *
FROM customers 
ORDER BY first_name 
To reverse the order:

SELECT *
FROM customers
ORDER BY first_name DESC
We can also sort data by multiple columns for example:

Let‚Äôs say we want to first sort customers based on their state and then within each state we want to sort them by their first name:

SELECT *
FROM customers
ORDER BY state, first_name 
We can also use a descending argument anywhere like:

SELECT *
FROM customers
ORDER BY state, first_name DESC 
The difference between MySQL and other DBMSs is that in MySQL we can sort by any columns whether that column is in the SELECT clause or NOT like:

SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM customers
ORDER BY state
Here although I don‚Äôt have state column in SELECT clause but I can sort data based on that. But other DBMSs sometimes yell at you when you try to do sorting like this.

We also can sort data by an alias like:

SELECT first_name, last_name, 10 AS points 
FROM customers
ORDER BY points, first_name 
AVOID: you can also sort data by columns position like:

SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM customers
ORDER BY 1, 2 ‚Äì these are the orders of the columns in the SELECT clause 
This query sorts data by first_name and then last_name.

BUT avoid this b/c if in the future you have a change in the columns in the SELECT clause like:

SELECT birth_data, first_name, last_name 
FROM customers
ORDER BY 1, 2
The data would be sorted differently and generates unexpected results and so avoid sorting by column‚Äôs positions INSTEAD ALWAYS SORT BY COLUMNS‚ÄôNAMES.

13. The LIMIT clause

How to limit the number of records from your query? Like if we only want to get the three first customers we use the LIMIT clause:

SELECT *
FROM customers
LIMIT 3
We can optionally supply an offset which is useful for situations we want to paginate data. Like:

SELECT *
FROM customers
LIMIT 6, 3 
Here 6 is an offset and tells MySQL to skip the first 6 records and then pick three records.

Exercise: get the top three loyal customers, like the ones with highest points

SELECT *
FROM customers
ORDER BY points DESC 
LIMIT 3 
POINT: Again the order matters! The LIMIT clause should always come at the end.

Retrieving Data From Multiple Tables
14. Inner Joins

So far we only selected columns from a single table but in the real world we quite often select columns from multiple tables. Like:

SELECT *
FROM orders
JOIN customers 
    ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id 
this JOIN is the same as INNER JOIN where INNER is optional, we also have OUTER JOIN, which will be discussed later

With this query we tell MySQL that hey whenever you are joining the orders table with customers table make sure that the customer_id column in the orders table equals customer_id column in the customers table.

The output would be all the columns from the two tables, first all the columns from orders table, b/c we have listed this table first, and then all the columns from the customers table. Let‚Äôs simplify the results:

SELECT order_id, first_name, last_name
FROM orders
JOIN customers 
    ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id 
What if we want to display the customer_id as well?

SELECT order_id, customer_id, first_name, last_name
FROM orders
JOIN customers 
    ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id 
This query throws an error b/c I have the column customer_id in two tables! The error says that customer_id column in the field list is ambiguous! So I need to specify from which table like:

SELECT order_id, orders.customer_id, first_name, last_name
FROM orders
JOIN customers 
    ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id         
Now it works!

Points:

In situations where we have same column in multiple tables we need to prefix the name of the column with the name of the table like above

ON phrase specifies the basis based on which we want to join the tables, after ON we need to specify the condition

We can use alias to make our code cleaner, NOTE: if you give an alias to a table you have to use that alias everywhere else otherwise you get an error.

  SELECT order_id, o.customer_id, first_name, last_name
  FROM orders o
  JOIN customers c 
      ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
15. Joining across databases

How to combine columns from tables across multiple databases?

What we did so far was to combine columns from multiple tables within a database, sql_store, but now we want to combine columns from tables across multiple databases. We need to prefix the table in JOIN with its database name:

USE sql_store;
SELECT *
FROM order_items oi
JOIN sql_inventory.products p 
    ON oi.product_id = p.product_id 
So we successfully joined tables across multiple databases.

We need this prefix, sql_inventory.products, b/c the database we write this query against is the sql_store database. Also

USE sql_inventory;
SELECT *
FROM sql_store.order_items oi 
JOIN products p 
    ON oi.product_id = p.product_id 
    
LESSON ----> I only have to prefix the tables that are NOT part of the current database. And so my query would be different depending on the current database.

16. Self Joins

In SQL we can also join a table with itself. Let‚Äôs write a query to get each employee and their manager

USE sql_hr;
SELECT 
    e.employee_id, 
    e.first_name, 
    m.first_name AS Manager
FROM employees e
JOIN employees m 
    ON e.reports_to = m.employee_id
    
Joining a table with itself is pretty similar to joining a table with another table the only difference is that we have to use different aliases and we have to prefix each column with an alias, this is called self join.

17. Joining Multiple Tables

How to join more than TWO tables when writing a query?

We want to write a query to join the orders table with two tables: the customers table and the order_statuses table.

USE sql_store;
SELECT 
    o.order_id, 
    o.order_date, 
    c.first_name, 
    c.last_name, 
    os.name AS status 
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c
    ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id 
JOIN order_statuses os 
    ON o.status = os.order_status_id 
    
Exercise: write a query to join the payment table with the payment methods table as well as the client table and produce a report that shows the payment with more details such as the client‚Äôs name and the payment method:

USE sql_invoicing;
SELECT 
    p.date,
    p.invoice_id,
    p.amount,
    c.name,
    pm.name AS payment 
FROM payments p
JOIN clients c 
    ON p.client_id = c.client_id 
JOIN payment_methods pm
    ON p.payment_method = pm.payment_method_id
